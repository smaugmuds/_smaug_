UNDERTAKER for Smaug 1.4a

Tested ok. This is basically for corpse retrieval. Pay the mob (undertaker) to
get back your corpse. I can imagine this would be pretty useful if you died in
a sadistically aggressive area and you'd really want your eq back. Just pop
into your local morgue and beg your friendly undertaker! Bring money!

It's very simple code. Room for improvements. I don't know if there's any such
function out there that's similar to this. But this is for smaug.

                                *****

1. In mud.h look for the mobile ACT_ bits. Do not add more than 31. Use only
   the unused ones. If there isn't any free 'slots' left, you might want to
   consider doing away with some act flags that you don't really use.

    #define ACT_UNDERTAKER      ??

Add also: (in the right place and in alphabetical order)

    DECLARE_DO_FUN( do_corpse );

2. In tables.c add in the right places and in alphabetical order:
      
    if ( !str_cmp( name, "do_corpse"  ))              return do_corpse;
    
    if ( skill == do_corpse  )          return "do_corpse";

3. Add the 2 functions at the beginning of this file to player.c

4. Make sure your mud is not running. Do a 'make clean; make'.

5. Add in ./system/commands.dat:

#COMMAND
Name        corpse~
Code        do_corpse
Position    100
Level       1
Log         0
End

7. Edit build.c, look for 
char * const act_flags []
{

and add the new flag in the right place (the order is set by the bit vector values) .
Example:

If you have 
#define ACT_HEALER               31    (in mud.h)

change to:
  {
  "npc", "sentinel", "scavenger", "r1", "r2", "aggressive", "stayarea",
  "wimpy", "pet", "train", "practice", "immortal", "deadly", "polyself",
  "meta_aggr", "guardian", "running", "nowander", "mountable", "mounted",
 "scholar", "secretive", "hardhat", "mobinvis", "noassist", "autonomous",
 "pacifist", "noattack", "annoying", "statshield", "prototype", "undertaker"
  };

Where 'npc' is bitvector 0, 'sentinel' is 1, and so on.

                                *****

A.
To mset an act_flag to a mob :
mset <mobname> flags undertaker
.. blah .. blah .. blah ..

B. PC's usage :
1. You must have died first of course.

2. Have some money. Visit your undertaker before your corpse decays completely.

3. 'corpse retrieve' or 'corpse' for help.

Bugs?

- You'd be charged x times the amount if you have x corpses around. However, all
  your corpses will be "retrieved". Even those in already in the morgue. The
  idea is not to make it a habit of dying; but if you have to, at least get rid
  of your corpse before you die again ;)

That's it.

Update from Samson 12-21-00:
Fixed a major bug where in the buffer holding the name of the object to be
retrieved only held the character's name. This would cause ANY object in the
game with that character's name in it to be brought to them, including object
being held by other players. The statement has been changed to correct this and
should now only retrieve corpses belonging to the player, regardelss of their
name.

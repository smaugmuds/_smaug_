IMC2 Freedom Client: Changelog
------------------------------

This is not necessarily a detailed list, just a general rundown based on a diff file
that was used to document the changes.

It was decided for purposes of clarity to begin a new changelog for the code.
Listing changes from the AntiFreeze client code would have been confusing
considering how much of it was gutted and replaced.

* Some permission checks were using atoi instead of imc_getpermvalue.
* Unset channel permissions should default to the permission sent during channel refresh.

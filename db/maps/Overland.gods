The Continental Portals~
This room is a huge magical focal point for the entire immortal plane.
In it, this energy is then channeled into the access portals that are
here. Each portal leads to one of the three continents of the planet
below. The Gods maintain these portals merely for their own amusement,
but their avatars are certainly known to benifit from them as well.
